# Introduction

`miaSim` implements tools for microbiome data simulation based on the
`SummarizedExperiment` [@SE], `microsim` .

Microbiome time series simulation can be obtained by generalized 
Lotka-Volterra model,`simulateGLV`, and  Self-Organized Instability 
(SOI), `simulateSOI`. Hubbell's Neutral model, `simulateHubbell` is used 
to determine the species abundance matrix. The resulting abundance matrix 
from these three simulation models is applied to `SummarizedExperiment`
object or `TreeSummarizedExperiment` object.

`powerlawA` and `randomA` give interaction matrix of species 
generated by normal distribution and uniform distribution, respectively.
These matrices can be used in the simulation model examples.

`tDyn` generates lists of time series that can be specified as simulation time 
and time points to keep in simulated time.

# Installation

### Bioc-release

```{r install-bioc,eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

    BiocManager::install("miaSim")
```

### The development version of the package 
[Github](https://github.com/microbiome/miaSim). 

# Models for simulating microbiome data sets 

The generalized Lotka-Volterra simulation model fitted to time-series estimates
microbial population dynamics and relative rates of interaction. The simulation
function is stored in `simulateGLV`

`simulateHubbell` includes the Hubbell Neutral simulation model which explains 
the diversity and relative abundance of species in ecological communities.

The Self-Organised Instability (SOI) model can be found in `simulateSOI` and it
generates time series for communities and accelerates stochastic simulation.

The simulations result in abundance matrix which can be used to form 
`SummarizedExperiment` [@SE] object.
