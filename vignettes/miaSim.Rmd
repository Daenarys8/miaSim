# Introduction

`miaSim` implements tools for simulating microbial community data
based on various ecological models. These can be used to simulate
species abundance matrices, including time series. A detailed
function documentation can be viewed at the [function reference
page](https://microbiome.github.io/miaSim/reference/index.html)


## Installation

Install the Bioconductor release version with

```{r install-bioc, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
```

Load the library

```{r load, eval=TRUE}
library(miaSim)
```

## Examples

### Generating species interaction matrices

Some of the models rely on interaction matrices that represents interaction
heterogeneity between species. The interaction matrix can be generated with
different distributional assumptions.

Generate interactions from normal distribution:

```{r}
A_normal <- powerlawA(n_species = 4, alpha = 3)
```

Generate interactions from uniform distribution:

```{r}
A_uniform <- randomA(n_species = 10, diagonal = -0.4, connectance = 0.5, interactions = runif(n = 10^2, min = -0.8, max = 0.8))
```

### Generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV)

The generalized Lotka-Volterra simulation model generates time-series assuming
microbial population dynamics and interaction.

```{r glv}
glvmodel <- simulateGLV(n_species = 4, A = A_normal, t_start = 0, 
    t_store = 100, t_end=100, stochastic = FALSE, norm = FALSE)

```

### Ricker model

Ricker model is a discrete version of the gLV:

```{r ricker}
rickermodel <- simulateRicker(n_species=4, A = A_normal, t_end=100, norm = FALSE)
```

The number of species specified in the interaction matrix must be the same as the species used in the models.

### Hubbell model

Hubbell Neutral simulation model characterizes diversity and relative abundance of species in ecological communities assuming migration, births and deaths but no interactions. Losses become replaced by migration or birth.

```{r hubbell}
hubbellmodel <- simulateHubbell(n_species = 8, M = 10, carrying_capacity = 1000,
                                k_events = 50, migration_p = 0.02, t_end = 100)
```

One can also simulate parameters for the Hubbell model.

```{r}
hubbellmodelRates <- simulateHubbellRates(x0 = c(0,5,10),
    migration_p = 0.1, metacommunity_probability = NULL, k_events = 1, 
    growth_rates = NULL, norm = FALSE, t_end=100)
```

### Self-Organised Instability (SOI)

The Self-Organised Instability (SOI) model generates time series for
communities and accelerates stochastic simulation.

```{r soi}
soimodel <- simulateSOI(n_species = 4, carrying_capacity = 1000,
              A = A_normal, k_events=5, x0 = NULL, t_end = 150, norm = TRUE)
```

### Stochastic logistic model

Stochastic logistic model is used to determine dead and alive counts
in community.

```{r logistic, eval=FALSE}
logisticmodel <- simulateStochasticLogistic(n_species = 5)
```

### Consumer-resource model

The consumer resource model requires the use of the `randomE`
function, which returns a matrix containing the production rates and
consumption rates of each species. The resulting matrix is used as a
determination of resource consumption efficiency.

```{r crmodel, eval=FALSE}
crmodel <- simulateConsumerResource(n_species = 2,
             n_resources = 4,
	     E = randomE(n_species = 2, n_resources = 4))

```

## Data containers

The simulation functions output a `TreeSummarizedExperiment` [@TreeSE]
object. This provides access to a broad range of tools for microbiome
analysis that support this format (see
[microbiome.github.io](http://microbiome.github.io)). More examples on
can be found at [OMA Online
Manual](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA). Other fields, such as
rowData containing information about the samples, and colData,
consisting of sample metadata describing the samples, or phylogenetic
trees, can be added as necessary.

For instance, we can use the `miaViz` R/Bioconductor package to
visualize the microbial community time series.

```{r visu}
library(miaViz)
miaViz::plotSeries(hubbellmodel, "time")
```
