Title: Microbiome Data Simulation
Description: 
    The time series simulation is observed by using generalized Lotka-Volterra model and 
    Self-Organized Instability (SOI) model. Along with time series simulation models, Hubbell's Neutral model
    is used to determine the abundance matrix. The resulting abundance matrix is applied to the \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} 
    object as an assay.
