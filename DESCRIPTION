Title: Microbiome Data Simulation
Description: 
    Microbiome time series simulation with generalized Lotka-Volterra model, 
    Self-Organized Instability (SOI), and other models. Hubbell's Neutral model
    is used to determine the abundance matrix. The resulting abundance matrix
    is applied to \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} or
    \linkS4class{TreeSummarizedExperiment} object.
