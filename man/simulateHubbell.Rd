\title{Hubbell's neutral model simulation}
\usage{
simulateHubbell(
  n.species,
  M,
  I = 1000,
  d = 10,
  m = 0.02,
  tskip = 0,
  tend,
  norm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.species}{Integer: the amount of different species initially
in the local community}

\item{M}{Integer: amount of different species in the metacommunity,
including those of the local community}

\item{I}{Integer: fixed amount of individuals in the local community
(default: \code{I = 1000})}

\item{d}{Integer: fixed amount of deaths of local community individuals
in each generation (default: \code{d = 10})}

\item{m}{Numeric: immigration rate: the probability that a death in the local
community is replaced by a migrant of the metacommunity rather than by
the birth of a local community member (default: \code{m = 0.02})}

\item{tskip}{Integer: number of generations that should not be included
in the outputted species abundance matrix. (default: \code{tskip = 0})}

\item{tend}{Integer: number of simulations to be simulated}

\item{norm}{Logical: whether the time series should be returned with
the abundances as proportions (\code{norm = TRUE}) or
the raw counts (default: \code{norm = FALSE})}
}
\value{
\code{simulateHubbell} returns an abundance matrix with
species abundance as rows and time points as columns
}
\description{
Neutral species abundances simulation according to the Hubbell model.
