# Changes (2022-05-30)

## added `names_species` and `names_resources` in related functions

## `randomA`
1. added parameter `interactions` and 5 interaction types to customize values and proportions of interspecies interactions
2. added `scale_off_diagonal `to avoid exponential growth in certain gLV modeling scenarios
3. added `list_A `to enable generating groups of species in simulation

## `randomE`
1. added trophic levels and trophic preferences
2. added `exact` to switch the number of resources to consume/produce between a poisson distribution and the exact number

## simulations
CRM, GLV, HubbellRates, and Logistic
1. added control of stochasticity, external events, migration from the metacommunity, and the extend of measurement errors to all these simulations
2. added microbial trophic levels (an implicit inter-species interaction) in `simulateConsumerResource`
3. put together result matrix and some parameters into a list containing the first element named 'matrix' to store the counts of species in the community

## conversion from simulation to SummarizedExperiment and plot using miaViz
An example could be found in convertToSE.R

## documentations for functions
shared templates of documentation in man-roxygen to avoid duplication

## other minor improvements

# What's changed

1. some names of parameters
2. ways to customize the distribution in `randomA` and `randomE`
3. tests using previous data formats

# Changes in version 0.99.0 (2021-09-29)
+ Three simulation models and three functions are added
+ Submitted to Bioconductor
